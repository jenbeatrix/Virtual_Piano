# Virtual_Piano
This project was made for my Signals Spectrum Processing class. It is composed of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) equipped with piano keys if the user wish to play the piano only using the keyboard or mouse. Aside from playing piano keys, there are also other functions employed in the GUI such as viewing the major and minor chords of the piano keys and etc. Virtual_Piano.class is the main GUI of the program. Other two classes are also considered as other functions of the program if the user wishes to view the keyboard layout or if they want to analyze the major and minor chords of the keys.
